# BPF Design

## Constraints

* Frequency Range: 8 - 100 kHz

## Criteria

* Speech Clarity
* Sound Quality
* Word Intelligibility
* Similarity to Original Sound
* Performance across sound types
* Performance in different environments
* Multiple-speaker scenarios
* Listening Effort
* Signal Reconstruction error
* Computation efficiency



Passband Ripple:

Acceptable Level: A passband ripple of Â±0.1 dB is generally considered acceptable. This level ensures minimal amplitude variation within the passband, preserving sound quality and speech clarity. 

Stopband Ripple (Attenuation):

Acceptable Level: A stopband attenuation of at least 60 dB is typically sufficient to suppress unwanted frequencies, preventing interference and maintaining signal integrity.

Window Functions: Applying window functions like Hamming or Kaiser can help control ripple levels and transition widths in FIR filter designs.
