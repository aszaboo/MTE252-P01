| **Sampling Rate Handling**| Techniques to manage different sampling rates during processing.              | - Ensures compatibility with various audio formats        | - Requires careful design to avoid aliasing               | When dealing with audio files of varying sampling rates |
| **Mono/Stereo Handling**  | Techniques for managing single vs. dual-channel audio files.                 | - Flexibility in audio output                               | - Stereo to mono conversion may lose spatial information   | When processing audio files with different channel formats |
